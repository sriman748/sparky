               <p style="font-size:130%;"> Computer security, cybersecurity (cyber security), or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of, or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.<br>
          <p style="font-size:130%;">The field has become of significance due to the expanded reliance on computer systems, the Internet, and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of things (IoT).</p>
          
          <p style="font-size:130%;"> Cybersecurity is also one of the significant challenges in the contemporary world, due to the complexity of information systems, both in terms of political usage and technology. Its primary goal is to ensure the system's dependability, integrity, and data privacy.
          Cyber security is a broad term that refers to the protection of computer networks and computer data from cyber attacks.Cyber security also includes prevention and detection of crime, such as hacking, phishing and malware distribution.<br>
          <p style="font-size:130%;">There are many factors that can cause an attack on a network or computer system.<br>
        
               The most common factors include:<br>
          
              - Lack of proper user authentication<br>
          
              - Lack of proper software updates, patches or operating system updates<br>
          
              - Software vulnerabilities in operating system software and applications left unpatched<br>
          
              - Malware, viruses and other malicious code (website code) left unpatched </p>
          
            <p style="font-size:130%;">Cyber security is a system that safeguards computerized devices from outside attack or manipulation.<br>
          
              <p style="font-size:130%;">Cyber security also refers to the process of protecting an asset like a computer, smart phone, or program from being accessed by an outside party in a manner that violates internal policies. <br>
          
                <p style="font-size:130%;">Cyber security is also known as information security and it's the practice of defending sensitive data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.<br>
          
                  <p style="font-size:130%;">Cybersecurity is the protection of system networks and computer hardware from cyberattacks.</p>

               <h1 font-family="ubuntu">History of Cyber Security</h1>
                <h5> Nov 03, 2022</h5>
             
                <p style="font-size:130%;">   The history of Cyber Security, or at least the discovery of the term, is not very old. In 1982, John McAfee developed an anti-virus program for home computers and later founded his namesake computer security company, McAfee.
                  <p style="font-size:130%;"> In 1983, a group of five other hackers founded the hacker organization L0pht Heavy Industries and released what is considered to be one of the founding documents in Cyber Security - "L0phtCrack".</p> 
                  <p style="font-size:130%;">This paper predicted that computers would eventually be used to control all aspects of daily life and this document was written by those who wanted to protect against such misuse.</p>
          
                  <p style="font-size:130%;">In 1984 the first-ever computer worm (a self-replicating program) was created and launched on ARPANET (the predecessor to the Internet). It spread to over 10% of all connected machines before it was terminated because it caused so much damage.</p>
          
                    <p style="font-size:130%;">Cyber Security is an emerging field that deals with the prevention, detection, and resolution of security breaches in electronic data.
          
                 A noteworthy woman in Cyber Security is Susan Landau.<p style="font-size:130%;"> She has a PhD from MIT and has researched computer security for over twenty years. Dr. Landau has advised the US Congress and White House on cyber threats to society, privacy and national security issues, including the NSA's surveillance program.
          
                  <p style="font-size:130%;">She believes there are major fundamental flaws in cyberspace architecture because it was designed by men who didn't take account of how women use the internet or computers at home or at work.</p>
          
                <p style="font-size:130%;">Cyber Security pioneer Susan Landau wants to change that as she pushes for more women to enter into a male-dominated industry.
          
                <p style="font-size:130%;">Cyber Security is a rapidly developing and changing field. As of now, the most common form of security is encryption, but it may not be enough for tomorrow.
          
              The history of Cyber Security can be traced back to the late 1940s. 
              <p style="font-size:130%;">At this time, people were creating passwords and sharing them with friends in order to keep their data safe. <br>This was one of the first and most basic forms of password protection available at that time.</p>
